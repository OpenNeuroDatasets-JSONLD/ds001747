Exploring the Resting State Neural Activity of Monolinguals and Late and Early Bilinguals

ABSTRACT
Individuals who speak more than one language have been found to enjoy a number of benefits not directly associated with the use of the languages themselves. One of these benefits is that bilingual individuals appear to develop symptoms of dementia 4-5 years later than comparable individuals who speak just one language. Studies on this topic, however, do not necessarily account for factors including if the individual learned their second language as a child or later in life, or their language proficiency. In an attempt to more carefully examine these variables, this study looks at structural and resting-state functional MRI scans of the default mode network, English and Spanish (where applicable) proficiency, language background, and demographics of young healthy adults who fall into one of three groups: early bilinguals, late bilinguals, and monolinguals. 

MRI METHODS

All imaging was performed on a 3T Siemens TIM Trio MRI scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel head coil at the BYU MRI Research Facility. Each participant contributed a structural MRI scan and a resting-state functional MRI scan. Structural scans used a T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1900ms; TE = 2.26ms; acquisition matrix: 215 × 256; field of view = 218 × 250mm; slice thickness = 1.0mm; voxel size =.977 × .977 × 1.0mm; flip angle = 9°; and number of slices = 176; GRAPPA factor = 2. Resting state fMRI scans were performed using a T2*-weighted EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 875ms; TE = 43.6ms; slice thickness = 1.8mm; acquisition matrix = 100 × 100; flip angle = 55°; number of slices = 72; field of view = 180 × 180mm; voxel size = 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.8mm; multi-band factor = 8; volumes per run = 823 (total scan time = 12min). EPI scans were oriented parallel to the long axis of the hippocampus. All MRI scans were imported from DICOM to NIfTI file format using program dcm2nii (v. 1JUNE2015; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron/). As part of the file conversion process, structural scans were reoriented to the nearest orthogonal using rigid-body transformation and extraneous field of view was cropped.
